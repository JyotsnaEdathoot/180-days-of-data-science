I took 21 hours for running the project in 5 million steps

But what I got is that my model is really overfitting

And instead of finisihing the track, the car is stuck circle-ing in it

Well, next I will do better

This failed mean a great lot for mean

Fine let's step ahead

**This is the first and the biggest failed when \
I start learn reinforcement learning \
I will not stop

>> **ich bin starker**
