# Day 101

Since day 100, I want to focus for deployment, but without leaving the building model part :)

This tutorial I got from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/model-deployment-using-flask-c5dcbb6499c9) and I rewrite all by myself, except all links.

But because the model computation for this project is big, perhaps I will use the model that had been provided by the writer
