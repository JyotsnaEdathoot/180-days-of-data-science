# Pitching day

This day I was did my first pitching in Siswa AI apps. That built by team as ArtificialIfElse. I was really glad could speak confidently in the AIC - COMPFEST13 Events. 

Hope this will be the beginning of my great adventure of my data science path. I believe evrybody that get the 90th day got the most likely same events, so what's yours?
